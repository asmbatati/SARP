Abstract— Large Language Models (LLMs) have demon-
strated promising reasoning capabilities in robotics; how-
ever, their application in multi-robot systems remains lim-
ited, particularly in handling task dependencies. This pa-
per introduces DART-LLM, a novel framework that employs
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to model task dependen-
cies, enabling the decomposition of natural language instruc-
tions into well-coordinated subtasks for multi-robot execution.
DART-LLM comprises four key components: a Question-
Answering (QA) LLM module for dependency-aware task
decomposition, a Breakdown Function module for robot as-
signment, an Actuation module for execution, and a Vision-
Language Model (VLM)-based object detector for environ-
mental perception, achieving end-to-end task execution. Ex-
perimental results across three task complexity levels demon-
strate that DART-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming the baseline across all evalua-
tion metrics. Among the tested models, DeepSeek-r1-671B
achieves the highest success rate, whereas Llama-3.1-8B ex-
hibits superior response time reliability. Ablation studies fur-
ther confirm that explicit dependency modeling notably en-
hances the performance of smaller models, facilitating effi-
cient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Please

I. INTRODUCTION
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated sig-
nificant reasoning capabilities that can be applied to robot
systems. Chen et al. introduced the Decision Transformer,
a reinforcement learning method that redefines decision-
making processes as sequence modeling problems [1]. Reed
et al. developed Gato, a generalist artificial intelligence
model capable of learning and adapting across multiple
tasks and modalities [2]. Ahn et al.’s FLAN-SayCan and
PaLM-SayCan leverage the capabilities of large pre-trained
language models (LLMs) to interpret and execute tasks
based on natural language instructions, enabling robots to
understand and perform tasks driven by complex natural
language commands [3]. Huang et al.’s Inner Monologue
method integrates language models into planning and rea-
soning processes, enhancing robots’ decision-making capa-

bilities [4]. Brohan et al. proposed RT-1, a model for real-
time control and decision-making in complex environments,
applying transformer architecture directly to robotics tech-
nology to ensure unprecedented precision and adaptability in
understanding and navigating the physical world [5]. Brohan
et al. further introduced the RT-2 model, which integrates
vision, language, and action capabilities, enabling robots to
autonomously learn and control actual actions from web
knowledge [6]. Driess et al.’s Palm-E model enhances the
perception and action capabilities of language models, offer-
ing a new way for artificial intelligence systems to interact
more naturally with the external world through enhanced
multimodal understanding [7]. Liang et al. launched Code as
Policies, enabling large language models (LLMs) to convert
natural language commands into robot strategy code with
minimal prompts [8]. Huang et al. introduced VoxPoser,
which extracts language-conditioned affordances and con-
straints from LLMs and applies them to the perceptual
space through VLMs. VoxPoser uses a code interface without
additional training for any component [9].
Despite
significant
advancements
in
LLM-powered
robotics research, most studies have primarily focused
on
single-robot
systems,
while
applications
in
multi-
robot systems remain at an early stage of exploration.
Multi-robot systems demonstrate significant potential in
complex task scenarios such as construction and disaster
rescue, improving task execution efficiency and enabling
collaborative problem-solving for tasks that are difficult for
a single robot to accomplish independently [10]. However,
multi-robot task planning still faces numerous challenges,
particularly concerning the complexity of mobile robots and
real-time execution. The RoCo framework proposed by Zhao
et al. employs LLMs for high-level task communication and
integrates multi-arm motion planning to accelerate trajectory
generation. It also incorporates environmental feedback
(e.g., collision detection), allowing the LLM to dynamically
adjust task plans based on context. However, RoCo is
designed for fixed-position robotic arm systems, making its
task planning approach less adaptable to mobile robots or
broader task scenarios [11]. Kannan et al.s SMART-LLM
has made progress in multi-robot task planning. However,
it generates outputs using Python and does not explicitly
handle dependencies among complex tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and rigidity of programming languages,
practical testing revealed a high failure rate. Furthermore,
SMART-LLM requires generating Python code that must
be manually executed, lacking real-time LLM inference

capabilities [12].
The comparison of the above-mentioned studies is shown
in Table I. Table I highlights two key challenges that persist
in multi-robot systems: (1) existing systems lack support
for end-to-end real-time execution across multiple types of
mobile robots; (2) current methods rely solely on the models
intrinsic reasoning ability without explicitly representing task
dependencies, which results in suboptimal performance, par-
ticularly for smaller models in handling complex tasks. For
instance, RoCo [11] lacks support for mobile robots, being
designed for fixed-position robotic arms, while SMART-
LLM [12] does not support end-to-end real-time execution
and fails to explicitly model task dependencies. To address
these limitations, we propose DART-LLM, A Dependency-
Aware Task Decomposition and Execution System for Multi-
Robot Coordination, as illustrated in Fig. 1. This study makes
the following contributions:
1. Dependency-Aware Task Decomposition Mechanism: A
novel task decomposition mechanism that utilizes a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) to model subtask dependencies. This
method significantly enhances system reasoning capabilities,
particularly improving the ability of smaller models to handle
complex task dependencies. It ensures proper task execution
order while maximizing overall efficiency.
2. End-to-End Real-Time Execution Framework: A real-
time execution framework includes the QA LLM mod-
ule, Breakdown Function module, Actuation module, and
a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based object detection
module. These modules perform Instruction Parsing and Task
Decomposition, Parsing of Decomposed Tasks, Grounding
in Embodiments, and Updating the Object Map Database to
accomplish task decomposition and execution from natural
language instructions to robotic actions.
3. Benchmark Dataset for Construction Robot Evaluation:
A dataset of 102 high-level natural language instructions for
construction robot tasks, designed with strict execution order
constraints and spanning three complexity levels.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
This section presents the foundational mathematical con-
cepts of the DART-LLM system. We formalize the definitions
of robot sets and their associated skills, team formation
with collaborative skill enhancement, task decomposition
into sub-tasks with temporal and dependency relationships,
and the skill library essential for task execution.
A. Robot Set and Skills
We define the set of all robots as:
R = {R1, R2, . . . , RN}
(1)
where N is the number of robots. The set of skills for all
robots are:
S = {S1, S2, . . . , SN}
(2)
B. Team of Robots and Team Skills
A team of robots is defined as:
A = {A1, A2, . . . , AQ}
(3)
where Q denotes the number of robots in the team. The skills
of a team of robots are expressed as:
SA = {S1
A, S2
A, . . . , SΩ
A}
(4)
where Ω≥Q. Here, Ωrepresents the total number of skills,
including both the individual skills of each robot and the new
skills generated through robot collaboration. The set of all
skills across all teams formed by N robots is:
∆=
[
SA
(5)
It should be noted that ∆includes S, the set of all individual
robot skills.
C. Task and Function Requirements
The high-level language instruction is represented as I,
and the environment is denoted by E. The instruction I is
decomposed using the QA LLM module into a set of sub-
tasks. A set of sub-tasks is defined as:
T = {T 1
t1, T 1
t2, . . . , T K
tj }
(6)
where K is the number of sub-tasks, and tj denotes the tem-
poral order of a sub-task. Since sub-tasks may be executed
simultaneously, we have j ≤K. Each task T k
tj should be
executable using the skills from the skill library within ∆.

An overview of the DART-LLM system architecture. The system is divided into three main modules: the Sensor Module, the Intelligent Command
Interface Module, and the Actuation Module. The Sensor Module captures and processes data using a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based object
detector, updating the object map with detected items. The Intelligent Command Interface Module interprets user instructions via a Question-Answering
Large Language Model (QA LLM), decomposing tasks into subtasks with dependencies through the Breakdown Function Parser and Handler. This allows
the establishment of complex task dependencies and coordination between multiple robots. Finally, the Actuation Module executes real-time operations
using the ROS Navigation stack, guiding each robot according to the parsed and dependency-aware instructions.

D. Dependency Relationships Between Tasks
Complex tasks in multi-robot systems often involve mul-
tiple subtasks with interdependencies. These dependencies
are managed through task decomposition using a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG). The DAG is defined as G = (T, D),
where:
D ⊆T × T
(7)
represents the set of directed edges indicating dependencies
between subtasks. An edge Dk = (T k−1
ti
, T k
tj) ∈D indicates
that subtask T k
tj depends on the successful completion of
subtask T k−1
ti
.
III. THE DART-LLM FRAMEWORK
This section provides an overview of DART-LLM. The
overall control architecture of DART-LLM is illustrated in
Fig. 1. Communication between all modules is based on

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) topics [13].
To illustrate the workflow of DART-LLM, Algorithm 1
presents the pseudocode for the system’s dependency-aware
multi-robot task decomposition and execution process. This
algorithm outlines the system’s processing of natural lan-
guage instructions through multiple stages, including instruc-
tion parsing, dependency-aware multi-robot task decomposi-
tion, dependency-aware task parsing and robot assignment,
and task execution with actuation. Following this high-level
overview, we detail each module shown in Fig. 1 and explain
how they implement the different stages of Algorithm 1 in
the subsequent subsections.

A. Instruction Parsing and Dependency-Aware Multi-Robot
Task Decomposition Using the QA LLM Module
This subsection details steps 1-8 of Algorithm 1, focus-
ing on how high-level natural language instructions I are
processed by the QA LLM module and decomposed into
executable subtasks with dependency relationships.
High-level natural language instructions I serve as the
input for DART-LLM. The input is first processed by the
QA LLM for Instruction Parsing and Dependency-Aware
Task Decomposition. The QA LLM parses the high-level
instructions I while considering the environment E and the
skills S possessed by all robots R.
In this module, we employ a DAG-based task decom-
position system that decomposes a given instruction I into
subtasks while also generating a dependency list for each
subtask to ensure correct execution sequencing. As shown
in Fig. 2, when instruction I is decomposed into a set of
subtasks T by QA LLM, each subtask T k
tj is assigned a
dependency list dk, which specifies all prerequisite subtasks
that must be completed before executing T k
tj. The system
then determines the execution order ti automatically based
on these dependencies and constructs a directed edge set Dk
for each dk, thereby forming a subtask execution graph as
illustrated. Finally, the system executes subtasks strictly in
the specified order until the overall task objective is achieved.
During Task Decomposition, DART-LLM uses awareness
of dependency relationships D to decompose the task into
multiple subtasks T = {T 1
t1, T 1
t2, . . . , T K
tj }, where each
subtask corresponds to an atomic skill in S. This facilitates
parallel execution of decomposed subtasks without mutual
dependencies and clearly expresses dependencies between
subtasks.
Therefore, the prompt P for the QA LLM is defined as
P = (I, E, R, S, F) , where F represents the few-shot exam-
ple, with explicit instructions that robot skills can combine
through teamwork.
The output of the QA LLM uses a structured standard for-
mat to handle the parsed commands and their dependencies.
The standardized structure follows JSON syntax, as shown
below:
{
"instruction_function": {
"name": "<breakdown function 1>",
"dependencies":["<dep 1>", "<dep 2>",
, "<dep n>"]
},
"object_keywords": ["<key 1>", "<key 2>",
, "<key n>"],
"instruction_function": {
"name": "<breakdown function 2>",
"dependencies":["<dep 1>", "<dep 2>",
, "<dep n>"]
},
"object_keywords": ["<key 1>", "<key 2>",
, "<key n>"],
...
"instruction_function": {
"name": "<breakdown function m>",
"dependencies":["<dep 1>", "<dep 2>",
, "<dep n>"]
},
"object_keywords": ["<key 1>", "<key 2>",
, "<key n>"]
}
The structured standard format message contains the


--- Page 5 ---
names of the breakdown functions (i.e., atomic action skills)
along with their parameters, object keywords, and depen-
dencies. These atomic action skills belong to S. For specific
atomic action skills, please refer to subsection III-C. The
parameters of the atomic action skills are searched within the
object map database. For details, please refer to subsection
III-D.
B. Dependency-Aware Task Parsing and Robot Assignment
Using the Breakdown Function Modules
This subsection elaborates on the implementation details
of steps 9-25 of Algorithm 1, particularly how the system
processes tasks according to their dependencies and assigns
robots to subtasks.
The system first initializes the object map database with
object locations and attributes using the VLM-based object
detector. This provides the environmental context necessary
for task execution and robot coordination.
Following the DAG structure established during task
decomposition, the system processes each subtask T k
tj in
topological order of the graph G. This ordering ensures
that subtasks are executed according to their dependencies:
- Subtasks without dependencies are executed in parallel,
maximizing efficiency - Subtasks with dependencies wait for
their prerequisite tasks to complete before execution
The Breakdown Function Parser module then processes
each subtask T k
tj ∈T for robot assignment. If the QA LLM
has specified a particular robot for a subtask, that robot
is directly assigned to the task. Otherwise, the Breakdown
Function Parser finds an available robot of the specified type
from R with the matching skill required for the subtask.
This dependency-aware approach to task parsing and robot
assignment ensures that complex tasks requiring collabora-
tion between multiple robots are executed efficiently while
respecting the necessary order of operations defined by the
dependency relationships in D.
C. Task Execution and Grounding Using the Actuation Mod-
ule
This subsection corresponds to steps 26-29 of Algorithm 1,
following the dependency-aware execution and robot assign-
ment described previously, detailing how the system grounds
instructions in robot actions through the actuation module.
The Actuation module grounds the instructions in embod-
iments by executing each parsed subtask T k
tj ∈T using the
corresponding atomic skill from S. All atomic action skills
are asynchronously executed by the Actuation module.
These atomic action skills are divided into two categories:
navigation skills and robot-specific skills, both contained
within S. The implementation of navigation skills is achieved
through the ROS Navigation stack [14], while robot-specific
skills are realized by creating specific action sets for each
robot.
1) Navigation Skills: The navigation skills are responsible
for directing the movement and area access permissions of
all robots or specific robots within a designated area. These
skills include whether to avoid certain areas, return to the
initial position, or move to a specified location. Table
II
provides detailed descriptions of each navigation skill.
2) Robot Skills: The robot-specific skills are tailored to
the unique operational capabilities of different robot types,
such as excavators and dump trucks. These skills handle tasks
such as digging, unloading, and loading. Table III provides
detailed descriptions of each robot skill. It should be noted
that different types of robots have different atomic action
skill definitions.
D. Update Object Map Database Using the VLM-based
Object Detector Module
This subsection explains steps 30-31 of Algorithm 1,
describing how the system continuously updates its object
map database through real-time sensing, which is crucial for
maintaining an accurate representation of the environment
throughout task execution.
The DART-LLM updates the object map database in envi-
ronment E using the VLM-based object detector module. The
object detector focuses on identifying the object keywords
that were extracted during QA LLM’s instruction parsing
phase, ensuring that all entities relevant to the current task
are properly detected and tracked.
This module first converts all images captured by Un-
manned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into bird’s-eye views. These
views are processed to detect and recognize objects in the en-
vironment E . Selective search [15] is then used on the bird’s-
eye views to generate candidate bounding boxes. Following
region proposals, a CLIP-based model [16] is employed for
identification, updating the object map database with the
names, locations, and shapes of the objects. The updated
information is then used by the Breakdown Function Handler
to ensure accurate parameter resolution for the atomic skills
during execution.
IV. EXPERIMENTS
A. Experimental Setup
To evaluate the performance of the DART-LLM system
across different task sets and conduct a quantitative compar-
ison with baseline methods, this study employs construction
robots that are highly sensitive to subtask sequencing. These
robots serve as test subjects to evaluate the system’s effec-
tiveness. Errors in subtask sequencing can lead to task failure.
For instance, if a dump truck departs from the soil pile before
the excavator has completed unloading, the loading and
unloading operation will be unsuccessful. We constructed a
benchmark dataset designed specifically for evaluating natu-
ral language-driven task planning in multi-robot construction
scenarios. The dataset includes three task levels: L1, L2, and
L3. The task numbering reflects their respective levels. L1
tasks are fundamental tasks involving a single robot equipped
with all necessary skills, eliminating the need for multi-
robot coordination. L2 tasks require collaboration among
multiple robots. These tasks consist of subtasks that must
be executed in a specific sequence, though each subtask
can still be completed independently by a single robot. L3
tasks are complex, requiring multiple robots to work together.

These tasks are decomposed into multiple interdependent
subtasks, which must follow a strict execution order but may
allow some parallel execution where feasible. The dataset
comprises 102 high-level instructions: 47 L1 tasks, 33 L2
tasks, and 22 L3 tasks. It is available on our project website:
project-dart-llm. Task execution can be visually validated
in both simulated and physical robot environments. The
simulation environment is built on the Unity platform and
employs the PhysX physics engine. Both the simulation and
physical environments feature two C30R tracked transport
robots manufactured by Yanmar (Japan) and one ZX120
excavator manufactured by Hitachi Construction Machinery
(Japan). Table IV presents two specific example tasks for
each task level, along with the required skills and applicable
robot types.
B. Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on
the dataset, this study employs five evaluation metrics:
• SR (Success Rate): Whether the task is completely
successful.
• IPA (Instruction Parsing Accuracy): The accuracy of
instruction parsing, defined as the proportion of cor-
rectly parsed instructions mapped to the correct atomic
action function names and parameters.
• DSR (Dependency Satisfaction Rate): The rate of
dependency satisfaction, referring to the proportion of
subtasks completed in the correct order of dependencies.
• SGSR (Semantic Grounding Success Rate): The rate
of successful semantic grounding, defined as the propor-
tion of code generated that can be successfully parsed
by the breakdown function parse module.
• RTR (Response Time Reliability): Assesses the mod-
els response time stability across multiple executions,
using average response time and standard deviation
to evaluate performance consistency under different
conditions.
The evaluation relies on dataset ground truth to measure each
metric.
C. Experimental Results
1) Evaluation Against Baselines Using Different LLMs:
This study evaluated DART-LLM using multiple foundation
models: Llama-3.1-8B [17], GPT-4o [18], GPT-3.5-turbo
[19], Claude-3.5-Haiku [20], and DeepSeek-r1-671B [21].
We also compared our approach with the SMART-LLM
baseline implemented with Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-r1-
671B. Table V shows the evaluation results across tasks
of L1, L2, and L3 complexity levels. Notably, all 102 test
cases were unseen data, using few-shot examples solely
for prompting and excluding them from the test set. All
evaluation metrics range from 0 to 1, with higher values
indicating better performance.
The results indicate that for task level L1, all imple-
mentations achieved perfect scores across SR, IPA, DSR,
and SGSR metrics (all 1.00). However, notable differences
appear in the RTR metric, where DART-LLM with Llama3.1
achieved the highest score of 0.96, significantly outperform-
ing other models including SMART-LLM implementations
(0.24 and 0.08).

followed with 0.96, Claude3.5 with 0.90, GPT-3.5-turbo
with 0.87, and Llama3.1 with 0.85. All DART-LLM im-
plementations maintained perfect IPA scores, demonstrating
the effectiveness of proposed structured JSON format and
dependency-aware task decomposition method. In contrast,
the SMART-LLM baseline showed substantial performance
degradation, with SR scores of 0.36 and 0.78 for Llama3.1
and DeepSeek-r1 respectively, and reduced IPA scores (0.57
and 0.78). The explicit specification of dependencies in pro-
posed approach significantly improved model logical reason-
ing capabilities, as evidenced by the high DSR scores across
all DART-LLM implementations compared to the SMART-
LLM baseline. For RTR, DART-LLM with Llama3.1 again
demonstrated superior performance (0.90) compared to other
models, while SMART-LLM implementations struggled sig-
nificantly (0.19 and 0.04).
At task level L3, DART-LLM with DeepSeek-r1 demon-
strated the best performance with an SR of 0.94. GPT-4o
followed with 0.93, while Claude3.5, Llama3.1, and GPT-
3.5-turbo achieved 0.86, 0.84, and 0.80 respectively. The
SMART-LLM baseline performance degraded substantially,
with SR scores dropping to 0.24 and 0.65 for Llama3.1 and
DeepSeek-r1 respectively.
The structured JSON format consistently contributed to
high RTR scores for DART-LLM (Llama3.1), maintaining
0.96, 0.90, and 0.86 across L1, L2, and L3 respectively. In
contrast, the SMART-LLM baseline implementations showed
markedly lower RTR scores (ranging from 0.02 to 0.24),
primarily due to its direct generation of more complex
Python code, which led to increased planning time for code
generation. While the SMART-LLM baseline achieved rea-
sonable SR scores with DeepSeek-r1, its low RTR indicates
significant practical limitations in real-world applications
where code execution is essential.
Overall, the DART-LLM system showed superior per-
formance when using DeepSeek-r1 for SR metrics and
Llama3.1 for RTR metrics. Notably, the Llama3.1 model,
with only 8B parameters, performed competitively with
much larger models and achieved significantly higher RTR
scores than all other approaches. This suggests that using
smaller models with proposed JSON-based command gener-
ation approach provides an excellent balance between perfor-
mance and deployability, offering better real-time capabilities
while maintaining high success rates.
2) Ablation Study: To evaluate the effectiveness of pro-
posed dependency-aware approach, we conducted an ablation
study on L3 complexity tasks using five different LLMs. We
compared two conditions: ”With Dependency” (i.e., using a
DAG to represent task dependencies) and ”Without Depen-
dency” (i.e., not using a DAG to specify task relationships).
Fig. 3 presents the SR under both conditions. The ex-
perimental results indicate that the ”Without Dependency”
condition (i.e., without using a DAG) significantly reduces
the performance of all models. Among them, Llama3.1

exhibited the largest performance drop (from 0.84 to 0.45).
Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-
r1 experienced notable declines (from 0.93 to 0.85 and from
0.94 to 0.89, respectively). The pronounced performance
gap in smaller models suggests that explicit dependency
modeling via DAG can effectively compensate for their
limited reasoning capabilities, demonstrating that proposed
approach enables smaller, more deployable models to achieve
competitive performance on complex tasks.
3) Deployment in Real World: To evaluate the deployment
capability of DART-LLM, we conducted tests in a real-world
environment. Fig. 4 presents the results of the L2-T1-001
task using the Llama3.1 model. The results indicate that
DART-LLM demonstrates good applicability on real robots.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presented DART-LLM, a novel framework
that leverages LLMs and DAG-based dependency modeling
for coordinated multi-robot task execution. The proposed
system integrates four key modules: a QA LLM module
for instruction parsing and dependency-aware task decom-
position, a Breakdown Function module for task parsing
and robot assignment, an Actuation module for executing
robot-specific skills, and a VLM-based object detector mod-
ule for environmental perception. This architecture demon-
strated superior performance compared to existing methods
across all evaluation metrics, with DART-LLM (DeepSeek-
r1) achieving a 94% success rate on complex tasks while
maintaining perfect instruction parsing accuracy. The smaller
Llama3.1 model exhibited exceptional response time reliabil-
ity, making it suitable for resource-constrained deployments.
Furthermore, ablation experiments reveal that DAG-based
dependency modeling significantly enhances model perfor-
mance. Notably, it compensates for the limited reasoning
capabilities of smaller models, enabling them to execute
complex tasks more effectively. Real-world testing validated
the system’s practical applicability. Future work will focus on

DART-LLM (Llama3.1) in the L2-T1-001 Task Using Real Robots:
The sequence begins at 0 [s] with the initial positioning of the Dump Truck
at the starting location. At 8 [s], the Excavator prepares to dig soil. By 24 [s],
the Excavator transfers the excavated soil into the Dump Truck, completing
the loading operation. At 48 [s], the loaded Dump Truck navigates towards
the designated dumping area. At 56 [s], the Dump Truck unloads the soil at
the puddle location. Finally, at 64 [s], the Dump Truck completes the task
by retracting its vessel.
scaling DART-LLM for larger multi-robot teams to enhance
system applicability. Additionally, optimizing the trade-off
between model size and performance will be investigated to
accommodate diverse deployment scenarios.
