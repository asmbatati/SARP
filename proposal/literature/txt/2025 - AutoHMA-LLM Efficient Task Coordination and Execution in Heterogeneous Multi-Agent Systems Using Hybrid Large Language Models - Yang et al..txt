Abstract—Heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS) com-
prise various intelligent agents with specialized functions, such
as drones, ground robots, and automated devices, working
in coordinated settings. This paper presents AutoHMA-LLM,
a novel framework that combines Large Language Models
(LLMs) with classical control algorithms to address the chal-
lenges of task coordination and scheduling in complex, dynamic
environments. The framework is designed with a multi-tier
architecture, utilizing a cloud-based LLM as the central planner
alongside device-speciﬁc LLMs and Generative Agents to improve
task execution efﬁciency and accuracy. Speciﬁcally targeting
dynamic scenarios, the system enhances resource utilization and
stabilizes task execution through reﬁned task scheduling and
real-time feedback mechanisms. In experiments conducted across
logistics, inspection, and search & rescue scenarios, AutoHMA-
LLM demonstrated a 5.7% improvement in task completion
accuracy, a 46% reduction in communication steps, and a 31%
decrease in token usage and API calls compared to baseline
methods. These results highlight our framework’s scalability and
efﬁciency, offering substantial support for effective multi-agent
collaboration in complex, resource-constrained environments.

agents with different capabilities. However, coordinating
communication and scheduling tasks presents signiﬁcant
challenges, with consistency in temporal protocols among
agents leading to inefﬁciencies and potential conﬂicts [4], [5].
Traditional task planning methods are poor in scalability
because of its static design, which require onerous code mod-
iﬁcation specially in complex environments. This underscores
the need for efﬁcient, intelligent, autonomous task scheduling
and communication coordination in these systems.
LLMs like GPT-4 [6], GPT-3.5 [7], and LLAMA2 [8]
excel in natural language understanding, logical reasoning, and
generalization. Capable of processing diverse data, generating
coherent responses, and adapting to various tasks, LLMs offer
innovative solutions to the challenges of communication coor-
dination and task scheduling in heterogeneous systems. LLMs
effectively address the complexities of dynamic environments
by enhancing understanding and planning capabilities and
optimizing resource utilization through intelligent task decom-
position and dynamic scheduling.
This paper introduces a novel framework utilizing a hybrid
of large and small models to address communication coor-
dination, dynamic task decomposition, and scheduling issues
in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Combining the under-
standing capabilities of large models with the computational
efﬁciency of small models, this approach coordinates tem-
poral protocols among agents, reduces inconsistencies, and
optimizes computational resource utilization. The framework
is advantageous for implementing autonomous multi-agent
networks wirelessly, maintaining high efﬁciency in various
environments, thus enhancing task reliability and performance.
The architecture achieves effective communication coordi-
nation and task scheduling by integrating LLMs’ powerful
reasoning capabilities with smaller models’ efﬁciency. This
includes a control layer, Cloud LLM, Device LLM, and
Generative Agents collaborating to optimize task allocation
and resource utilization. Our contributions include:
• A hybrid LLM architecture that coordinates scheduling
using large and small models addresses coordination and
scheduling inefﬁciencies and enhances task execution
efﬁciency.
• Discussion of six communication methods, including
decentralized and centralized coordination strategies,
which comprehensively veriﬁed the characteristics of
different architectures and model combinations.

II. RELATED WORKS
A. Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MARL) [9]
has enhanced agent capabilities in various jobs, such as
path planning, obstacle avoidance and agent control. This
makes it possible to build complex multi-agent systems.
Q-learning [10] operates on the principle of maximizing the
expected sum of rewards across all consecutive steps. This
algorithm enables agents to make decisions based on strategies
that yield the highest returns over the long term, which is
crucial in dynamic and complex environments. Integrating
Q-learning into MARL frameworks such as MA-PPO [11],
QMIX [12], and QPLEX [13] has enhanced their effectiveness,
providing a robust mechanism for agents to assess and adjust
their strategies in real time. MA-POCA [14] utilizing these
principles combined with counterfactual reasoning from the
COMA [15], further optimizes reward distribution among
agents, signiﬁcantly enhancing cooperation and collective
decision-making within agent groups. This paper also utilizes
Q-learning within Generative Agents, achieving notable results
across various scenarios.
B. LLMs for Multi-Agent
LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing multi-
agent systems in planning, coordination, and task reasoning.
Early works like SayCan [16] and Inner Monologue [17]
focused on single-agent scenarios, using environmental feed-
back to improve planning and scheduling. Studies such as
CaP [18], ProgGPT [19], and Demo2Code [20] demonstrated
LLMs’ capability in generating adaptable policies, broadening
their applications to diverse tasks and agent behaviors. In
motion planning, frameworks like AutoTAMP [21] and LLM-
GROP [22] integrated LLMs with traditional Task and Motion
Planning (TAMP), enabling more dynamic task execution in
complex environments. However, these efforts were largely
limited to single-agent or centralized planning [23].
Recent research has shifted towards multi-agent systems,
addressing
challenges
in
collaboration
and
scalability.
RoCo [24] introduced a dialectic framework for LLM-driven
multi-robot collaboration, facilitating interaction and coordi-
nation among agents. Another study [25] examined centralized
and decentralized multi-robot frameworks, utilizing LLMs
to enhance task distribution and communication. Building
on these advancements, our approach introduces a novel
multi-agent framework that employs LLMs for real-time task
reasoning and strategy adjustment. Unlike previous works
relying on static policies or single-threaded planning, our
framework dynamically adapts to complex, interdependent
tasks, improving both scalability and performance in multi-
agent environments.
C. Multi-Agents Collaboration and Planning
Research in multi-agent manipulation has a long-standing
history. The ﬁrst cluster of studies focuses on low-level
problems such as ﬁnding collision-free motion trajectories,
where sampling methods are commonly employed, and var-
ious algorithmic improvements have been proposed. Recent
efforts have also explored learning-based methods. Some work
focused on addressing more challenging scenarios requiring
sophisticated low-level controls, such as involving dynamic
objects or closed-chain kinematics [24]. The second cluster of
work concentrates more on high-level planning to allocate and
coordinate sub-tasks, which is more relevant to our work [25].
Although most prior work customized their systems for limited
tasks like furniture assembly [26], our work emphasizes the
ﬂexibility and scalability to accomplish a wide range of tasks
in real-world scenarios.

multi-agent systems [27] in diverse operational scenarios
usually encompass different entities, which we denote as

IV. METHOD
A. Multi-Agent System Architecture
This section elaborates on the overall framework and
deployment architecture of the heterogeneous multi-agent
system proposed. As depicted in Figures 1, it integrates Cloud
LLM, Device LLMs and Generative Agents. The primary goal
of this system is to achieve intelligent scheduling and coor-
dinated work through efﬁcient task decomposition, allocation,
coordination, and feedback mechanisms.
1) Overall Framework: Within this architecture, the cloud
LLM is a central planner responsible for receiving and
reﬁning task directives from the control layer into actionable
instructions for speciﬁc agents. It continuously optimizes
task allocation and execution by leveraging real-time node
self-correction feedback and environmental feedback. These
reﬁned task directives will be disseminated to Device LLMs,
ensuring an effective distribution and execution of tasks across
various devices. As the planner, the Cloud LLM coordinates
task allocation in global, while fostering collaboration among
agents through real-time feedback mechanisms, ultimately
enhancing the system’s efﬁciency.

Fig. 2.
Deployment structure of the AutoHMA-LLM system, highlighting
the hierarchical coordination among the Cloud LLM, Device LLMs, and
Generative Agents, enabling real-time task execution and feedback in a
wireless network environment.
Device LLMs, serving as dispatchers, are embedded in vari-
ous devices like tablets, laptops, and unmanned vehicles. They
receive task directives from the Cloud LLM and relay detailed
subtask plans to Generative Agents. Depending on the agents’
attributes and the task requirements, Device LLMs dynam-
ically adjust execution plans and guide Generative Agents
to perform speciﬁc operations. Through a real-time feed-
back loop, Device LLMs monitor and revise task execution
progress, guaranteeing efﬁcient task delivery and execution
among Generative Agents.
Generative Agents, as executors, receive subtask directives
from Device LLMs and perform tasks ranging from logistics
transportation to equipment inspection or search & rescue mis-
sions. As they execute, they generate updated state information
and provide feedback to both device-level and Cloud LLMs
for real-time adjustments and optimizations. In addition to
leveraging the strengths of LLMs in task planning and schedul-
ing, Generative Agents also utilize smaller models to execute
speciﬁc tasks based on subtask action directives, exhibiting
high execution efﬁciency and system-wide coordination. For
instance, the employment of Q-Learning model for global path
planning enables agents to navigate more efﬁcient and adaptive
in complex environments.

the Generative Agents. Based on the agents’ feedback, Device
LLMs dynamically adjust task execution plans, ensuring efﬁ-
cient task execution by the agents.
As the actual executors, Generative Agents perform speciﬁc
actions based on the instructions from the Device LLMs.

inspection robots, can operate efﬁciently in diverse task scenar-
ios. Through a real-time feedback mechanism, the Generative
Agents transmit task execution status information back to the
device level and Cloud LLMs, enabling timely task adjust-
ments and optimizations. By executing tasks efﬁciently and
providing real-time feedback, the Generative Agents enhance
the system’s execution efﬁciency and safety, ensuring the
successful completion of tasks in complex environments.
B. Communication Mechanisms
As illustrated in Figure 3, we discuss six communication
modes: the Decentralized Small Model, the Decentralized
LLM, the Decentralized Hybrid Model, the Centralized LLM,
the Centralized Small Model, and the Centralized Hybrid
Model.
The Decentralized Small Model (Fig. 3(a)) enables each
small model to independently plan and execute tasks, with
agents performing decentralized communication and coordi-
nation. This method reduces the burden on the central node
but may lead to poor coordination and resource wastage,
particularly in complex tasks requiring efﬁcient collaboration.
The lack of a global perspective in decentralized agents
can result in uneven task distribution, redundant work, and
suboptimal resource utilization.
The Decentralized LLM (Fig. 3(b)) allows each agent to
use a large language model for task planning and execution,
communicating and coordinating in a decentralized way. While
this enhances the decision-making capabilities of the agents,
the high computational complexity of LLMs leads to reduced
efﬁciency in resource-constrained environments.
The Decentralized Hybrid Model (Fig. 3(c)) combines large
and small models, with agents communicating and coor-
dinating in a decentralized manner. Small models handle
speciﬁc tasks, such as point-to-point path planning and obsta-
cle avoidance, while large models are used for overall task
decision-making. This approach improves efﬁciency to some
extent but still suffers from the inherent issues of decentral-
ization, such as high coordination complexity, lack of a global
view, uneven resource distribution, and task redundancy.
The Centralized LLM (Fig. 3(d)) employs a central LLM
for task planning and scheduling, with all agents receiving

and executing instructions from the central node. This method
ensures uniform task distribution and scheduling but risks a
single point of failure.
The Centralized Small Model (Fig. 3(e)) utilizes a central
small model for task planning and scheduling, with all agents
following the central instructions. This approach is suitable for
resource-limited environments but may struggle with complex
tasks.
The Centralized Hybrid Model (Fig. 3(f)) blends the central
large and small models, combining the strengths of both to
enhance system efﬁciency and reliability. This hybrid approach
ensures a balanced and effective task execution, adapting to the
limitations of edge devices while maintaining high operational
efﬁciency.
The
proposed
centralized
hybrid
model
(Centralized-
Hybrid) combines the advantages of both large and small
models, offering an efﬁcient task planning and scheduling
approach. The Cloud LLM works as a core coordination
module, reﬁning task instructions in real-time according to
subordinate information. The Device LLM, acting as the
dispatcher, dynamically adjusts execution plans based on agent
attributes and current task demands, directing Generative
Agents to perform speciﬁc operations. This approach boasts
efﬁcient scheduling and ﬂexibility: the central LLM handles
complex task planning, while the Device LLM reﬁnes tasks
and guides speciﬁc executions.
The resource requirements of the centralized system can be
represented as,
RCENTRALIZED = CLLM +
N

i=1
Ci,
(8)
where RCENTRALIZED is the total resource requirement of
the centralized system, N is the number of agents, and Ci is
the resource consumption of each agent.
C. Introduction to Task Process
The proposed framework achieves efﬁcient task planning
and execution in multi-agent systems through four pri-
mary parts: Command Delivery, Task Decomposition, Agent
Collaboration, and Feedback. Each component is crucial
in optimizing the performance of heterogeneous multi-agent
systems, as shown in Figure 4.
1) Command Delivery: The Command Delivery compo-
nent transmits task instructions from the central control node
to each agent. Speciﬁcally, the central control node generates
an overall task plan based on mission requirements and
disseminates these instructions to the individual agents. Upon
receiving the instructions, each agent plans and executes its
tasks according to the instructions received.
Effective information transmission and coordination are
critical during the command delivery process. Each agent must
know its tasks and those of others to facilitate coordination
and cooperation. This process can be expressed as,
C(T) =
N

i=1
Ci(T),
(9)
where C(T) denotes the set of commands at time T, Ci(T)
represents the command delivered to agent i at time T, and N
is the number of agents.
2) Task Decomposition: Task Decomposition means break-
ing down the overall task into multiple subtasks and assigning
them to agents respectively. This step requires considering
task dependencies and agent capability constraints to ensure
efﬁcient execution of each subtask and achieving the overall
task objectives. The process of task decomposition can be
represented as,
T =
M

j=1
Tj ,

--- Page 6 ---
992
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING, VOL. 11, NO. 2, APRIL 2025
where T denotes the set of all tasks, Tj represents the j-
th subtask, and M is the number of subtasks. Further task
allocation can be detailed as,
Tj =
N

i=1
Tij .
(11)
During task decomposition, we provide the LLM with
environmental information E (including objects and entities
in the environment) and a list of primitive skills Δ that the
agents can perform. This information helps the LLM generate
subtasks T ′:
T ′ = LLM(I , E, Δ),
(12)
where I is the input instruction, E is the environmental
information, and Δ is the list of agent skills.
3) Agent Collaboration: Agent Collaboration organizes
and coordinates all nodes based on the decomposed tasks. It
forms one or more agent coalitions to collaboratively complete
tasks, considering communication and coordination among
agents to ensure smooth task execution. The process of agent
collaboration can be described as,
A(T) =
K

k=1
Ak(T),
(13)
where A(T) is the set of coalitions at time T, Ak(T) represents
the k-th coalition at time T, and K is the number of coalitions.
Each coalition’s composition can be expressed as,
Ak(T) =
Nk

i=1
i.
(14)
To achieve effective collaboration, the LLM analyzes the skill
sets required for each subtask TSk and the skills of individual
agents Si:
A′(T) = LLM(T, S),
(15)
where T is the set of decomposed tasks for device control, and
S is the set of agent skills.
4) Feedback: The Feedback mechanism is a critical com-
ponent of the proposed multi-agent framework, ensuring
dynamic adaptability and optimization throughout task execu-
tion. During each iteration, the central planner decomposes
a global task into subtasks, assigning each device agent
speciﬁc responsibilities (e.g., equipment inspection) along
with corresponding 3D path points within the task space.
Device agents then generate a globally optimized path and
delegate speciﬁc 3D path computations to smaller models
tailored for local execution. This iterative process incorporates
multiple validation steps to ensure robust task execution. If
any validation fails, the system reverts to the previous state;
otherwise, successful feedback is integrated into the agents’
prompts for subsequent iterations.
This step ensures the subtask plan adheres to required
formats and constraints. It validates the generated output by
checking syntax accuracy, ensuring all required keywords
and available actions are included. Furthermore, it evaluates
whether each action satisﬁes the operational constraints of the
task and the capabilities of the assigned agent. This early-stage
check eliminates structural errors and ensures compatibility
with the overall task objectives.
After generating and executing actions, each Device LLM
reviews its performance and provides localized feedback to the
central planner. This feedback includes execution outcomes,
encountered challenges, and adjustments made by the device
agent. This mechanism allows for real-time reﬁnement of task
decomposition and allocation strategies at the central level,
enhancing overall system responsiveness.
To prevent conﬂicts during path planning, the system
employs global obstacle avoidance strategies, such as PID
control, Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), and Q-
Learning. These methods verify that the planned path is free
from collisions and adheres to environmental constraints. Any
potential collision triggers a re-evaluation of the path, ensuring
safe navigation through complex environments.
The system evaluates intermediate waypoints to ensure
smooth and efﬁcient transitions. It optimizes path charac-
teristics by minimizing movement distance, balancing step
distribution, and reducing execution time. The goal is to
achieve the most effective trajectory for task completion while
adhering to safety and resource constraints. If any validation
step fails, the system attempts to replan the subtask up to a
predeﬁned maximum number of iterations. Should the task
remain incomplete within this limit, the iteration is marked as
a failure, and the system proceeds to the next cycle without
executing any incomplete actions.
The combination of the central planner’s dynamic task
decomposition, collaborative agent interactions, and compre-
hensive feedback mechanisms forms a robust feedback loop.
This loop continuously reﬁnes task execution at both local and
global levels, enhancing the efﬁciency and reliability of the
system. By leveraging self-correction, self-feedback, collision
checks, and optimal path planning, the proposed framework
ensures that multi-agent operations are adaptable, resilient,
and capable of meeting the demands of diverse and dynamic
environments.
V. EXPERIMENTS

narios: logistics, inspection, and search & rescue. The
scenario design is informed by insights from the review
presented in [31], and detailed descriptions are provided in
Figure 5.
Logistics. In this scenario, multiple intelligent agents col-
laborate to complete the transportation task of items, which
uses UAVs, Autonomous Vehicles, and Warehouse Robots.
Each agent moves along its path (red, blue, and green)
according to task requirements and ultimately delivers the
item to the designated location (star point). Inspection. In this
scenario, UAVs, Inspection Robots, and Sensors collaborate to
complete the facility’s inspection and monitoring tasks. UAVs
ﬂy along the red path, robots move along the green path,
and sensors are ﬁxed at a speciﬁc location. They coordinate
their work through wireless communication to complete the
facility’s inspection. Search & Rescue. In this scenario, UAVs,
Ships, and Rescue Robots collaborate to carry out Search
& Rescue missions. UAVs ﬂy along the red path, ships
navigate the blue path, and robots move along the green path,
intended to locate and rescue individuals or items trapped in
a speciﬁc location. We will build single or hybrid large and
small models to accomplish heterogeneous entity collaboration
tasks in logistics, inspection, Search & Rescue scenarios
under centralized and decentralized architectures. We choose
GPT-4 [6] and Llama2-70B [8] as large models representing
open-source and closed-source LLM, respectively. On the
other hand, small models employ classic control algorithms,
PID [28] and NMPC [29], along with the Q-learning [10].
The controlled objects include the speed and direction of cars,
the propeller speed and angle of ships, and UAVs’ attitude
and quadcopter power. All experiments will be conducted
in a MATLAB simulation environment, which realistically
simulates environmental interference factors typical of these
scenarios.

2) Experimental
Environment: Logistics.
We
simulated
intelligent logistics scenarios using MATLAB 9.12, in which
cars, UAVs and robots collaborate to handle the task of item
transportation and distribution. In order to simulate a real
complex trafﬁc environment, we added cars with random
destinations at a lane occupancy rate of 5% to 60%. Inspection.
In MATLAB 9.12, UAVs, robots, and sensors collaborate to
inspect and monitor the facility. To simulate harsh natural
and communication environments, we set a 10% probability of
communication delay and a 1% probability of terminal data
communication loss to the system. Search & Rescue. Also
simulated in MATLAB 9.12, in which UAVs, ships and robots
collaborate to rescue people or property trapped at sea. We built
a random rough surface with winds in irregular directions to
simulate substantial interference on the sea.
B. Success Rate Statistics and Analysis
Table I shows the performance of the proposed method in
three scenarios. Experimental results of the Centralization-
Hybrid are shown in Figure 6. We have experimented with

TABLE I
THIS TABLE PRESENTS THE PERFORMANCE OF AUTOHMA-LLM ACROSS DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. THE CENTRALIZED HYBRID MODEL
OFFERS THE BEST ACCURACY AND EFFICIENCY, WHILE THE DECENTRALIZED SMALL MODEL MINIMIZES COSTS BUT WITH LOWER
ACCURACY. NOTE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT EXPLICITLY SHOWN HERE, A ‘HYBRID’ VARIANT UNDER DECENTRALIZATION COULD
ALSO BE CONSIDERED (WITH APPROPRIATE DATA, WHICH IS NOT PROVIDED)
decentralized and centralized architecture designs. Under dif-
ferent system architecture designs, control algorithms for
small, large, and hybrid models were implemented separately,
forming six strategies. Then, measure their Success, represent-
ing the system’s accuracy; Steps, reﬂecting the ability to break
down complex tasks; API Calls, showing the additional cost
of executing strategies; and Tokens/Data Size, which means
the complexity of the communication process. The results
show that in both logistics and rescue scenarios, a centralized
hybrid model architecture has the best accuracy in completing
tasks. At the same time, the communication overhead is also
moderate, making it the most cost-effective solution. The
decentralized small model minimizes the cost (API calls and
Tokens/Data Size). However, its accuracy is signiﬁcantly lower
than the other ﬁve strategies, making it almost impossible to
use in the real world.
Centralized small models have lower communication costs
and higher accuracy, making them a viable low-cost solution.
The accuracy of large centralized models is lower than that of
the former, and communication costs have sharply increased,
making it a less cost-effective solution.
The inspection scenario faces a harsh communication envi-
ronment that weakens the heavy communication model in
the system. Thus, the decentralized hybrid model performs
best in this scenario because it eliminates complex and long
distance communication with central nodes and also combines
the collaborative ability of large models to compensate for the
difﬁculty of miniature models in collaboration.
Introducing large models can signiﬁcantly improve system
accuracy, but it increases communication costs. The heavy
communication requirements of large models often become
system bottlenecks, so the excessive reliance on large models
will reduce the system’s robustness. Combining large and
small models can complement each other’s strengths, ensuring
high accuracy while reducing communication costs.
C. Model Performance Comparison
Table II shows the performance of small model, large
model, and hybrid model schemes in three tasks under a
centralized architecture.The experimental results show that
both GPT-4 and Llama2 can ﬁnish processing complex and
heterogeneous data returned by the terminal and issuing
instructions according to the speciﬁed protocol, reﬂecting
the powerful information integration ability of LLM. Among
them, whether as a central scheduler or terminal executor,
GPT-4 has signiﬁcantly better system accuracy compared
to Llama2, indicating that with the improvement of LLM
comprehensive performance, there is also considerable room
for improvement in the performance of control systems based
on LLM agents.
In Inspection scenario with an unreliable communication
environment, a single LLM has the most signiﬁcant gap com-
pared to the reinforcement learning scheme, with a reduction
of about 8% to 16%. The reason is that when LLM participates
as an agent in collaborative tasks, it needs to provide detailed
descriptions of task rules, current environment, and current
state in multiple rounds of dialogue, which leads to a surge in
communication overhead. In scenarios with delays and packet
losses, it is difﬁcult for the central module to issue correct,
reliable, and timely instructions to the terminal. At this point,
the advantage of hybrid models is particularly signiﬁcant, as
they can asynchronously call traditional control algorithms
or reinforcement learning models to solve most problems,
avoiding serious deviations due to untimely communication.
The LLM only needs to provide correction suggestions based
on the current state at speciﬁc times.
Besides, in the logistics and search & rescue scenarios
without communication delay and packet loss, the hybrid
architecture can still improve the system accuracy by about
3% 16%. This is because the combination of the reinforcement
learning model and LLM increases the diversity of terminal
output, which signiﬁcantly beneﬁts the LLM module centrally
scheduled. After all, the more diversiﬁed the information
provided, the more it can stimulate the ability of LLM.
D. Task Planning and Execution
1) Task Planning: Figure 7 shows the experimental results
of the multi-agent system we proposed in three complex
scenarios: logistics, inspection and search & rescue. All agents
(including UAVs, ground transportation robots, inspection
robots, ships, etc.) in each scene will cooperate to complete the
task. The ﬁgure shows the motion trajectories of each agent

at three different times and the location and path of the agent
in the process of task execution.
In the logistics scenario (Fig. 7a-7c), the agents include
UAV (red path), ground transportation robot (blue path) and
warehouse robot (green path). At T1 (Fig. 7a), the UAV takes
off from its initial position, while the ground transportation
robot and the warehouse robot also begin to move along the
predetermined path. At T2 (Fig. 7b), the UAV continues to ﬂy
in the air, and the ground transportation robot approaches its
target position while the warehouse robot is in the middle of
the path. The UAV reached the ﬁnal position at T3 (Fig. 7c),
and the ground transportation robot completed transporting
goods. At the same time, the warehouse robot also completed
the task and arrived at the designated place.
In the inspection scenario (Fig. 7d-7f), the agents include
UAVs (red path), inspection robots (green path) and sensor
(grey ﬁxed point). At T1 (Fig. 7d), the UAV takes off for
patrol inspection, and the robot starts moving along the path
while the sensor node is ﬁxed at a particular position. At T2
(Figure 7e), the UAV patrols in the air and the inspection robot
continues to move close to the equipment to be inspected. At
T3 (Figure 7f), the UAV completes the inspection task, the
robot completes the equipment inspection task, and the sensor
node continues monitoring the environment.
In the search & rescue scenario (Fig. 7g-7i), the agents
include UAV (red path), ship (blue path) and rescue robot
(green path). At T1 (Fig. 7g), the UAV took off to start the
search task, while the ship and rescue robot began to move
along the path. At T2 (Figure 7h), the UAV searches for targets
in the air, the ship approaches the rescue position, and the
rescue robot moves to the designated area. At T3 (Figure 7i),
the UAV ﬁnds the target and completes the search task, the ship
arrives at the rescue position, and the rescue robot completes
the rescue task.
The performance of this architecture veriﬁes its ability to
work intelligently in heterogeneous agent systems. As the
central planner, Cloud LLM is responsible for the overall
planning and allocating of tasks. As the dispatcher, the Device
LLM receives the task instructions from the cloud, details
them into speciﬁc action parameters and transmits them to
the Generative Agent. As the executor, the Generative Agent
executes speciﬁc tasks according to the instructions of the
Device LLM and feeds back the task execution status in
real-time. Through the collaborative work of small models
(Device LLM) and large models (Cloud LLM), efﬁcient task
decomposition, task allocation, and execution processes are
realized. In complex task scenarios, the system shows high
ﬂexibility and reliability and effectively meets the challenges
of multi-agent cooperation.
2) Collision Preventation: There is a risk of collision
between agents when performing multi-agent collaborative
tasks in complex scenarios. This can also be seen as a unique
collaborative problem, and all six strategies mentioned above
can avoid it in an ideal environment. However, we found that
the collision probability of control schemes based on large

models could be better in actual simulation experiments. The
reason is that the large models are relatively slower than others,
and they cannot timely issue collision avoidance instructions
in dynamic and complex environments. This is also one of
the reasons why the accuracy of a single large model scheme
in 4.2 is worse than that of a small model. Figure 8 shows
a Q-learning collision avoidance model that can quickly and
reliably achieve multi-agent collision avoidance. Integrating it
into a hybrid model effectively solves the problem of delayed
obstacle avoidance in large models, thereby ensuring the safety
and practicality of the system.
Our system’s fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms are
designed to seamlessly handle agent failures or communication
disruptions. When an agent fails or loses communication, the
system automatically detects the failure and triggers a recovery
process, which may involve reassigning tasks to other agents,
using backup agents, or adjusting the task plan. The framework
employs redundancy, where critical tasks are assigned to
multiple agents to ensure task completion even in case of fail-
ure. Communication disruptions are mitigated through periodic
status checks and local decision-making, allowing agents to
continue performing tasks autonomously until communication
is restored, ensuring resilience and minimizing the impact of
failures on task execution.
E. Comparative Analysis With Existing Methodologies
The
results
in
Table III
illustrate
the
advantages
of
the proposed AutoHMA-LLM framework over the base-
line method in [25] in terms of task completion accuracy,
communication efﬁciency, and computational performance
across logistics, inspection, and search & rescue scenarios.
AutoHMA-LLM demonstrates consistent superiority in task
completion accuracy, achieving an 85.73% success rate in
the logistics scenario compared to 81.42% with the method
in [25]. Similar improvements are observed in the inspection
and search & rescue scenarios, with AutoHMA-LLM outper-
forming the baseline by 1.24% and 2.98%, respectively. These
improvements underscore AutoHMA-LLM’s adaptability and
robustness in heterogeneous multi-agent environments.
AutoHMA-LLM also signiﬁcantly reduces communication
overhead, as reﬂected in fewer communication steps, tokens
exchanged, and API calls. For instance, in the logistics
scenario, the number of communication steps decreased from
9.55 to 5.11, and the token count reduced by 36.42%. These
reductions are consistent across all scenarios, with API calls
in the logistics task dropping by 32.32%. Such efﬁciency
is attributed to the hybrid architecture of AutoHMA-LLM,
which leverages lightweight, specialized models for localized
decision-making, thereby reducing frequent interactions with
the LLM. In contrast, the centralized coordination approach
in [25] leads to higher communication demands.
In terms of computational performance, the Memory (MB)
statistic presented in Table III speciﬁcally refers to the
memory usage of the Device LLM, reﬂecting the computa-
tional footprint at the local device level. For instance, in the
inspection scenario, AutoHMA-LLM reduces memory usage
from 60 MB to 40 MB, while computation time is short-
ened from 11.0 s to 7.8 s. This reduction demonstrates that
AutoHMA-LLM achieves a better balance between memory
consumption and processing efﬁciency. The ability to integrate
high-level reasoning with task-speciﬁc computations enables
AutoHMA-LLM to operate effectively in resource-constrained
environments, offering signiﬁcant advantages over existing
centralized methods.

dination and execution in heterogeneous multi-agent systems

using LLMs. AutoHMA-LLM shows how Cloud LLM,
Device LLM and Generative Agents can jointly optimize task
planning, allocation and execution. Our method solves the
traditional challenges in multi-agent systems by enhancing
communication, reducing resource waste and improving the
system’s overall efﬁciency. The experimental results verify
our framework’s effectiveness in various application scenarios,
highlighting its potential in dynamic and complex environ-
ments. Future work will continue to improve our framework,
explore more application scenarios, and enhance the adaptabil-
ity and robustness of the system.
